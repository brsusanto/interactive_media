<i><strong>Candy Box!</strong></i> is an incremental online text-based role-playing game that runs in web browser. It was developed by a 19-year-old French student using the pseudonym "aniwey" and released in April 2013. <i>Candy Box!</i> uses ASCII art for the visuals.
</div>
<div>
    The game revolves around candies, which players begin to receive, at a rate of one per second; however this number may increase with further gameplay. Gameplay appears very sparse initially, but options appear as the player performs actions.  
For example, candy can be eaten or used to purchase items. Players can eventually undertake quests and kill monsters in order to gain candy. By performing quests, the player obtains items which can be accessed in their inventory.

<i><strong>Yehwan Song</strong></i> is a South Korean web artist and designer who creates anti-friendly, non-user-centric, unconventional, and diverse independent websites through which she tries to flip the general understanding of web design and subvert user behaviours. Song aims to illuminate inequalities in the digital environment and reframe digital accessibility.

 <i>  "In my practice I focus on the insecurity and discomfort elicited by the web â€“ a negative aspect that tends to be hidden behind technological utopianism and immoderate expectations of comfort, speed, and ease of use. I reveal the discomfort experienced especially by users who are not considered to be part of the major user group. I believe that digital discomfort derives from a lack of consideration for diversity and the deprivation of care." </i>
