        <p><strong>Speculative HCI</strong> : 
        What gestures / behaviours interfaces are "under-exploited"? Imagine & sketch 2-3 
        speculative interfaces that do not yet exist. What are they for? how do they work?</p>

        <p><strong>Gesture for Smoke Alarm</strong>: I thought a voice recognition gesture where you could turn off
            your smoke alarm instead of having to press the button at the top of the smoke alarm would be incredibly useful. 
            I have an incredibly sensitive smoke alarm that has become very annoying when I cook so being able to turn the alarm
            off when I yell "THERES NO FIRE!" would be great. A remote control for the smoke alarm would be great too...

        <p><strong>A Gesture for getting ready to leave</strong>: it would be pretty great to have a gesture activated my sound/touch, 
            one that could send me a notification on my phone that reminds me of things I may forget before I leave my apartment floor
            (eg. keys, wallet, etc) as soon as my phone hears my foot stomp twice when I put my shoes on as I leave.

        <p><strong>Designing Wireframes</strong></p>

        <p><img src="images/wk2content1.jpg" class="imgcontent" > </p>

        <p>I started off with a sketch of 8 wireframes - some quick sketches were a bit more conventional website design, with text on the left and images or videos on the right,
          or others following a standard grid. Other wireframes that I eventually gravitated towards led to more interesting ideas, such as the "mind map" design where the different elements would be linked
          together like a mind map, or one that looks like scattered pages of paper, where the text and elements would be slanted to the angle of the paper. 
         </p>

        <p><img src="images/wk2content2.jpg" class="imgcontent"> </p>

        <p>Eventually I went with one where all the different elements would be grouped into "flowers" like a flower garden, with the idea of having thumbnails of images to form the shape
          of flower petals with the leaves to open up some sort of popup window for that week's content.

          Other ideas of the website that I would like to develop is a way to animate the different flowers when you hover over each week, perhaps a slight wiggle animation or
          have the flowers to be growing. I also designed it so that the flowers line up in a timeline for all the different weeks and have you scroll horizontally over the timeline. 

          I was suggested to create assets for the flowers with Illustrator and to look into absolute position within the css so that I could place buttons that could open up a window when the flower images are clicked.

        <figcaption>David Rudnick - Stem</figcaption>
        
        <p>I thought it would be a cool idea to play around with a design in which I try to make the flower garden to look more digital than it
          does natural, given that it is a "flower garden" that purely exists on the web. I was initially inspired by David Rudnick's flower nfts 
          as well as Lena Weber's flower animations.</p>

        <p><img src="images/wk2content4.png" class="imgcontent"> </p>
        <figcaption>Flower iterations</figcaption>

        <p>I initially tried creating the flower with a series of gradients overlayed onto each other, but wasn't satisfied with the outcome. I eventually
          tried simplyfying it the next iteration, but ended up ditching more of the gradient idea with something more flat and "wireframe" like - I was particularly inspired
          by the design of Yehwan Song's cascading spiral project, and thought it would be a cool idea to have the sides of the flower petals be thumnails of the images within the window.

        <figcaption>Website Landing Page mockup draft</figcaption>
        <p>
          I made a quick mockup of what I wanted my site to look like on Illustrator with the final flower assets i designed. I thought it would be cool if I could possibly make
          the popup window warped to a different perspective to play around with 3d perspectives.

        <figcaption>CSS and js for popup</figcaption>

        <p>the initial draft of the site had all the flower images set to the bottom of the page styled in CSS with the absolute position
          suggestion taken. when the flower images are clicked it opens up a new popup window to a separate html file for the weeks content.
          I then eventually changed the script to instead have the flowers open a div window within the same html. 
        </p>

        <p><img src="images/wk3content4.png" class="imgcontent" > </p>
        <p><img src="images/wk3content5.png" class="imgcontent" > </p>
        <figcaption>New CSS and js for popup</figcaption>

        <p>the new code makes it so that it toggles the visibility of the div window when I click a flower. it switch between .hidden and .popup, 
          where the hidden displays no window. A function to create the windows draggable was also added to to the script.
        </p>

        <p><img src="images/wk3content6.png" class="imgcontent" > </p>
        <figcaption>Current website</figcaption>
        <p>the current site has been spruced up so that the flower opens up a draggable div window within the site, with each window with vertical scroll.
          I changed the bacground image for site as well to an iframe of a video of a flower garden that I found online, with a bit of editing within Premier pro, changing
          the blur of the video so that the elements appear a bit clearer. 

          Eventually I would like to make the flowers have some anuimation when I hover over it, perhaps play around with styling further and change font styles, and maybe change
          the cursor image to a watering can.
